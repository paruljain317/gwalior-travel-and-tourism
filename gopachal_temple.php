		<p style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">Gopachal rock-cut Jain monuments, also called Gopachal Parvat Jaina monuments, are a group of Jain carvings dated to between 7th and 15th century. They are located around the walls of the Gwalior Fort, Madhya Pradesh. They depict Tirthankaras in seated Padmasana posture as well as standing Kayotsarga posture, in the typical naked form of Jain iconography.<br><br>The number of Jain rock shrines at Gwalior, with numerous monumental statues, is unmatched anywhere else. James Burgess writes: "In the 15th century, during the reign of the Tomara Rajas, the Jains seem to have been seized with an uncontrollable impulse to convert the cliff that sustains the fort into a great shrine in honour of their religion, and in a few years excavated the most extensive series of Jaina caves known to exist anywhere." <br><br>
			There are five clusters of monuments that surround the hill:
			<li style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">South-East Group: Popularly referred to as Ek Patthar Ki Bawadi group, the cluster is now termed the "Gopachal Atishya Kshetra" by the local Jain community. The group includes 26 caves in a row spanning about half a mile. There are 13 inscriptions from 1468-1473 AD. The entrace to the site is close to the Dindayal City Mall.</li>
			<li style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">South-West Group: Now termed Trishalagiri.[citation needed] The group is the first one encountered when driving to the Urvai Gate, just outside the fortifications. There are the oldest Jain monuments in Gwalior from the post-Gupta period. Archaeologist L.B. Singh dates them to 6th to 8th cent AD.</li>
			<li style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">Urvahi group: In both sides of the road, just before entering the hilltop fort gate. Thse are the most visited since they are visible from the road itself. There are six inscriptions from 1440-1453 AD.</li>
			<li style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">North-West group: Now termed Naminath Giri group after Lord Naminath. They are hard to access. There is an inscription of 1470 AD. The group appears to have escaped the destruction by Babur, and thus the monumental image of Lord Naminath is in its pristine form.</li>
			<li style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">North-East group: Now termed Naimgir group after Lord Neminath.</li></p><br>

		<p style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">The Gopachal rock cut monuments are a part of nearly 100 Jain monuments found in and around the Gwalior city, but these are dated earlier than the Siddhachal Caves located about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of these monuments. Both monuments were defaced and desecrated around 1527 when the Emperor Babur ordered their destruction. Centuries later, the Jain community restored many of the statues by adding back stucco heads on the top of the damaged idols. The prolific Apabhramsha author Raidhu was responsible for consecrating many of the Jain rock carved images as attested by multiple inscriptions. These include the two colossal images of Shri Adinatha (57 feet) and Shri Chandraprabha. Mughal Emperor Babar conquered Gwalior in AD 1527. Babar ordered the destruction of the Jain statues, as he mentions in his memoirs. The heads of the statues at Urvahi gate and the Ek Patthat ki Bawadi were damaged. The Urvahi gate sculptures were repaired at some later time by the local Jains.</p><br>
