		<p style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">Gurdwara Data Bandi Chorh Sahib, situated in Gwalior, is associated with the imprisonment of Guru Har Gobind Sahib in Gwalior Fort and his celebrated release in which he managed to win the freedom of 52 Rajas (Kings) who had long suffered imprisonment in the Fort. The word "Bandi" means "imprisoned", "Chhor" means "release". The Gurudwara has immense religious importance and is visited by the followers to pay homage to the great man.<br><br>Built inside the Gwalior Fort, the Gurudwara was constructed in 1970. Made up of marble and colourful stained glass exteriors, the Gurudwara is one of the significant Sikh pilgrimage sites and is visited by many tourists each year. Jehangir gave instructions that whoever holds the robe of Guru would be freed. This incident earned the Guru the title of Data Bandi Chhod.

		Spread over six acres, the Gurudwara complex houses the Scindia School, Guru ka Langar with its huge dining hall and staff accommodation rooms in its adjoining compound.

		The most familiar version has Emperor Jahangir being warned by Murtaja Khan, Nawab of Lahore, who noticed that Guru Ji had constructed the Sri Akal Takhat Sahib, 'The Throne of the Almighty', at Amritsar, and was also strengthening his army, he informed the Mughal Emperor Jahangir about this incorrectly, emphasizing that the Sikh Guru was making preparations to take revenge for his father's torture and martyrdom. When Jahangir heard about this he at once sent Wazir Khan and Guncha Beg to Amritsar in order to arrest Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji. Given the severity of the brutal torture inflicted on Guru Arjan, Jahangir would have had ample reason to believe that the young Guru was coming for his head.<br><br>

		But Wazir Khan, who was an admirer of Guru Hargobind, requested the Guru to accompany them to Delhi telling him that Emperor Jahangir wanted to meet him. Guru Sahib accepted the invitation and soon reached Delhi. However Guru Hargobind was a man totally assured of himself who by his mere appearance and evident holiness charmed Jahangir and his wife Noor Jahan (said to be the real power in Jahangir's Darbar.) . But the same evil men who had plotted the arrest and torture of Guru Arjan hatched a plot aimed at similar fate for Guru Hargobind. In this well told version Jahangir falls terribly ill, his Astrologers predictions end with Guru Hargobind seemingly a prisoner in Gwalior Fort whose prayers are the only cure for Jahangir. The Sikhs, after the Martyrdom of Guru Arjan, fear the worst, but the Guru is not worried in the least, even as the same powerful Hindu Courtier Chandu Shah planned his death.</p><br>
