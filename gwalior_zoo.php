		<p style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">Gwalior is an exciting city with a rich heritage, and the Gwalior Zoo is just another feather in the cap. Established by the royal family Madhao Rao Scindia back in 1922, the Gandhi zoo (as it is also known) is actually a section of a larger garden known as Phool Bagh and houses various rare species of animals. Golden peasants, sambhars, bison, hyena, spotted deer, black bucks and a white tiger forms the variety of wild animals that can be found here. Several smaller populations of crocodiles, snakes, monkeys, and birds have also made the zoo their home.<br><br>
		Due to its inhabitation of rare species of wild animals, the 8 hectares of land that constitutes the zoo has been declared to be a protected site, maintained by the Municipal Corporation of Gwalior as part of its inheritance. The Phool Bagh was inaugurated by the Prince of Wales almost a hundred years ago, and it continues to be well-maintained and conserved even today, including the provision of good and clean habitation facilities for the animals. The Phool Garden also houses a prayer hall, gurudwara, mosque as well as a theosophical lodge.<br><br>
		The Gwalior Zoo makes for a pleasant outing with family, especially for kids. It is also an attractive destination for enthusiasts who would like to see wildlife in the city, including rare and protected species such as the white tiger.</p><br>
