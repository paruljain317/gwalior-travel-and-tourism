		<p style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">Located in the Shivpuri district of Gwalior region is another attraction called the Madhav National Park that is popular for its many stunning monuments. All the monuments that you see in the Madhav National Park are associated with Gwalior and also with the rich flora and fauna. Spread over 355 sq km this is one attraction that you must visit when in Gwalior. Before Independence the park was known for its tiger population and also as a royal game place for the rulers of the Gwalior state of that time. As per some records, it is said that Lord Hardinge shot down eight tigers when he visited this park in 1916 and Lord Minto shot down 19 of them, something that doesn’t make us happy. It was declared to be a national park in the year 1958 and today this park is a perfect mix of both dry thorn and deciduous forest. This park has several trees and is rich in wildlife too. Of all the tress that you get to see there, some of the major ones are the khair, kerdhai, tendu,dhawda, palas and also the salai. And if we have to talk about the wild animals, then you are definitely going to be treated to the views of deer, nilgai, blackbuck, leopard, chinkara, chausinga and several others. It is also home to many birds both domestic and migratory. Gese Pintai, teal, gadwall, mallard and pochard are some of the many birds that you will get to see here and if you are a bird watcher, trust us you are in for a visual delight. If you want to catch a good glimpse of these birds, go to the area where the forest crosses the stream filled with rocks. Apart from what was mentioned above, the other species of birds that come here are the Indian pond heron, kingfisher that is white breasted and also the red wattled lapwig. The park also houses birds like white ibis, purple sunbird and golden oriole.<br><br>

		Another attraction of the park is the George Castle that was built by Madho Rao Scindia who was a ruler in 1911. It was built at the highest point so that King George V of UK could stay overnight to shoot down tigers from this point. However, when he did visit Gwalior, he could easily shoot a tiger on his way without having to go up till this point. What you must do is go to the top to experience breathtaking views of the lake and the pristine surroundings that look magical during sunset.<br><br>

		The two lakes that played a major role in supporting the biodiversity of the park are the Sakhya Sagar and the Madhav Sagar Lake. It was created on the Manier River in 1918. The lake is situated in the corner side of the forests of this park. You will also find a boat club popularly called as the sailing club. You can take a boat ride and also take the pleasures of watching birds fly from the Shooting box that was made by the Scindias as a viewing lodge. The lake also has many reptiles like the crocodile and also the Indian python. 
		Spread across the beautiful Vindhya mountain ranges, the Madhav National Park is home to numerous lakes, Sakhya Sagar lake also becomes home to numerous species of migratory birds. The Madhav National Park is home to a wealth of numerous wildlife species that also include predators like leopards, panthers and hyenas. Besides these, there are a variety of other animals like sambar, nilgai, chital, sloth bear, dhole and crocodiles. One of the things that attract travellers to Madhav national Park is the fact that the wildlife sanctuary is also home to an interesting heritage site in the form of George Castle, which was built in 1911 by Jivaji Rao Scindia and is located right in the middle of the national park’s core area. Unlike other wildlife destinations, the Madhav National Park is a place which proves to be a great place to visit for travellers at all times of the year.<br>
		If you prefer staying close to the Madhav National park then you can opt for the rest house that is owned and managed by the state tourism department. The best time to visit the park is anytime from October to March, especially during the summers when spotting animals and migratory birds is easier. It would be better if you could carry your own food and water since the Madhav National Park and the surrounding areas has limited eating options.<br></p><br>
