		<p style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">Located at the North-east end of the fort, Man mandir palace was built between 1486 and 1516 by the Tomar ruler, Man Singh Tomar. The palace couldn't survive with time, however the remains of the palace still showcases the beautiful carvings and designs of that era.<br>
		Though some part of the palace has disintegrated with time, there are still some sights to see which provide an insight into the royal lives of the Tomars.</p><br>

		<h4 style="font-family: 'Limelight' ;font-size: 30px; font-weight: "><u>Architecture of Man  Mandir Palace:</u></h4>
		<p style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">The Maan Mandir Palace is also another great sightseeing spot. Built by the Tomar dynasty Maharaja Man Singh in 15th century, if the stories are anything to go by it is said that this palace was built by him for his queen Mrignayani who was also his favorite queen. Man Mandir is often referred as a Painted Palace because the painted effect of the Man Mandir Palace is due to the use of styled tiles of turquoise, green and yellow used extensively in a geometric pattern. The effect that it gives makes for a breathtaking view.<br><br>The palace has two open courts in between with apartments on two levels. There are underground prison cells as well, built later by Mughals. This was the place where Aurangzeb prisoned his brother Murad and poisoned him slowly to death by using opium. If you can find a local guide, he/she would be able to tell you various secrets about the place and show you various parts of the palace, which otherwise you won't be able to see. Nearby Jauhar Kund is the place where various Rajput women committed mass suicide to avoid rapes by the forces of Iltutmish who was the king of Delhi in the 13th century AD. The palace is also surrounded by other monuments like Jehangir Mahal, Shah Jahan Mahal and the Gujari Mahal.</p><br>

		<h4 style="font-family: 'Limelight' ;font-size: 30px; font-weight: "><u>How To Reach Man Mandir Palace: </u></h4>
		<p style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">The best way to reach the Gwalior Fort is through auto-rickshaw which can go up to the Urvai Gate, the western entrance of the fort. There are two approaches to the fort, the second one being the eastern entrance which does not allow any vehicle. Both the paths are steep treks after one point. However, the stunning view of this striking fort from the eastern side makes the whole trip worthwhile. Make sure not to miss the beautiful rock sculptures on your way down from the western side.</p><br>
